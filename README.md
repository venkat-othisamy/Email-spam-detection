# email-spam-detection
A project to predict whether the emails are spams or not. Have historical data.

Built two sets of models to
<li>Increase the Accuracy of the prediction</li>
<li>Reduce the mis-classification cost</li><br>
<p>Wrote codes to visualize ROC curve, Cumulative Response curve and Lift curve as Python doesn't have any inbuilt libraries to visualize them.</p>

Used as many algorithms as possible and optimized the models to see the performace comparision.

### Accuracy.ipynb
Models that are optimized for maximum accuracy

### Mis-classification-cost.ipynb
Models that are optimized for minimum misclassification cost
