# email-spam-detection
A project to predict whether the emails are spams or not. Have historical data.

Built models to
<li>To increase the Accuracy of the prediction</li>
<li>Reducing the mis-classification cost</li>

Wrote codes to visualize ROC curve, Cumulative Response curve and Lift curve as Python doesn't have any inbuilt libraries to visualize them.

Used as many algorithms as possible and optimized the models to see the performace comparision.
